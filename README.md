Things I would work on with more time:

- Address should be broken into multiple database columns - address 1, address 2, city, state, zip.
- add addtional validation around the website_url
- add pagination to the index view/api
- error handling on the front end
- front end tests
- factories for back end tests

This was my first time writing React (I've previously used Svelte).
